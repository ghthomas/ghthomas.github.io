#Macroevolution group

Welcome to the Macroevolution research group website. Our research focuses on modelling the diversification of species and traits at a macroevolutionary scale.

We are currently preoccupied with collecting a large database of bill shapes and plumage colours from all extant bird species (~10,000 species) using museum study skins (mainly the NHM at Tring and also the University of Manchester Museum). More about this ERC funded project from the links below.
